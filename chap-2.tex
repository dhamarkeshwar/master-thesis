\chapter{Packed Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing}
\label{cha:2}
In most of the real time distributed applications, each participant runs as a dealer once to share their 
secrets with other participants. To retrieve back the secret, remaining participants need to open their 
shares and perform a bunch of operations to reconstruct the secret, which requires a lot of communication 
amongst the participants. During the whole time of secret reconstruction one could have asked to the dealer 
itself to reveal the secret which will save a lot of time and communication. This is the main motivation 
behind the work of \textit{Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing} (PPVSS) \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, 
where the authors have given the complete description of PPVSS and an example $\Lambda_{RO}$ to improve 
the original e-voting protocol proposed by Schoenmakers \cite{5581ccd9530540479539d21d1d39ae96}.\par

In this chapter we will introduce Packed Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPPVSS) which merely 
is an extension to the notion of PPVSS. As Packed Shamir Secret Sharing \ref{sec:packed-shamir} allows a 
dealer to share multiple secrets encoded in a single polynomial, we want to add this feature to PPVSS. In the 
subsequent sections we will give our definitions for PPPVSS, give a construction of our packed secret sharing 
scheme and finally show some security guarantees our scheme can achieve.\par

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:pppvss-definitions}

The following definition directly follows the definition of PPVSS in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}.

\begin{definition}[Packed Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPPVSS)]
    A Packed PPVSS scheme should have four algorithms, namely, Initial, Share, Verify and Reconstruction whose 
    descriptions are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Initial} $(1^\lambda)\rightarrow\{PK_i\}_{i=1}^n\sqcup\{PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$: 
          When given $1^\lambda$, each party $P_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ registers their public key $PK_i$ in a 
          public ledger and withholds the corresponding secret key $sk_i$. Also, all parties and the dealer $D$ 
          agree on $\ell$ commitment keys or public keys whose secret keys are known to some target people.
        \item \textbf{Share} $(n,t,f_0,\{PK_i\}_{i=1}^n\sqcup\{PK_j\}_{j=-(l-1)}^0)\rightarrow(\{y_i\}_{i=0}^n,\pi_{PPPVSS})$: 
          It secret shares 
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
