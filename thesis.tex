\begin{preface}
  I express my gratitude to all those who have supported me throughout my master's thesis 
  journey. I thank my promoter, Prof.\ Nigel P. Smart, for this opportunity and remarks 
  during my mid term presentation. I am grateful to my assessors, Prof.\ Frederik Vercauteren and 
  Dr. Steven Keuchel, for reading and evaluating this thesis report.\par

  Shout out to my daily supervisors, Dr.\ Karim Baghery and Mr.\ Mahdi Rahimi, for their 
  guidance and immense support throughout my thesis work. I had a great time doing the research 
  for my thesis with them, where I learned a lot more about proof systems. I sincerely 
  thank Dr.\ Karim Baghery for explaining some important concepts that were crucial 
  for this thesis and we still have good ideas to explore, hopefully in the future.\par

  Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family and friends for their
  unwavering support and encouragement throughout this journey. I would'nt be here without them.

\begin{abstract}
  Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) is amongst the popular choices in some applications 
  which require public Verifiability when the secret is shared amongst entities. The goal 
  of this thesis is to revisit some applications which can be made more efficient in a 
  secure way using PVSS.\par
  
  Firstly, some preliminaries are recalled, followed by a literature review. The 
  sections on preliminaries will give a clear insight into the security properties of 
  the popular Shamir secret sharing which this thesis is based on, and in the section 
  on literature the more recent 
  advancement in PVSS is discussed. The discussion on recent advancement is mainly on 
  the new variant of PVSS proposed in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, which the authors 
  call it Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPVSS). Following this 
  discussion, this thesis proposes an extension to PPVSS and gives two practical schemes 
  along with their security proofs.\par

  Approaching to the goal of this thesis, an application is revisited and some changes are proposed 
  using the proposed extension of PPVSS to make it more efficient without 
  compromising much in security.\par
