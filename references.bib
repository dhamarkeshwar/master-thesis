abstract = {A secret-ballot vote for a single proposition is an example of a secure distributed computation. The goal is for m participants to jointly compute the output of some n-ary function (in this case, the sum of the votes), while protecting their individual inputs against some form of misbehavior.In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the communication complexity of unconditionally secure multi-party computation, and its relation with various fault-tolerance models. We present upper and lower bounds on communication, as well as tradeoffs among resources.First, we consider the “direct sum problem” for communications complexity of perfectly secure protocols: Can the communication complexity of securely computing   a single function f : Fn → F at k sets of inputs be smaller if all are computed simultaneously than if each is computed individually? We show that the answer depends on the failure model. A factor of O(n/log n) can be gained in the privacy model (where processors are curious but correct); specifically, when f is n-ary addition (mod 2), we show a lower bound of Ω(n2 log n) for computing f O(n) times simultaneously. No gain is possible in a slightly stronger fault model (fail-stop mode); specifically, when f is n-ary  addition over  GF(q), we show an exact bound of Θ(kn2 log q) for computing f at k sets of inputs simultaneously (for any k ≥ 1).However, if one is willing to pay an additive cost in fault tolerance (from t to t-k+1), then a variety of known non-cryptographic protocols (including “provably unparallelizable” protocols from above!) can be systematically compiled to compute one function at k sets of inputs with no increase in communication complexity. Our compilation technique is based on a new compression idea of polynomial-based  multi-secret  sharing.Lastly, we show how to compile private protocols into error-detecting protocols at a big savings of a factor of O(n3) (up to a log factor) over the best known error-correcting protocols. This is a new notion of fault-tolerant protocols, and is especially useful when malicious behavior is infrequent, since error-detection implies error-correction in this case.},

The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1{\%} to 4{\%} of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.",

The first part of this article argues that a particular combination of these two kinds of mechanism can overcome the limitations of each alone, providing both security and correctness for organizations as well as privacy and even anonymity for individuals.",

abstract = "A publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme is a verifiable secret sharing scheme with the property that the validity of the shares distributed by the dealer can be verified by any party; hence verification is not limited to the respective participants receiving the shares. We present a new construction for PVSS schemes, which compared to previous solutions by Stadler and later by Fujisaki and Okamoto, achieves improvements both in efficiency and in the type of intractability assumptions. The running time is O(nk), where k is a security parameter, and n is the number of participants, hence essentially optimal. The intractability assumptions are the standard Diffie-Hellman assumption and its decisional variant. We present several applications of our PVSS scheme, among which is a new type of universally verifiable election scheme based on PVSS. The election scheme becomes quite practical and combines several advantages of related electronic voting schemes, which makes it of interest in its own right.",
