\label{chap:preliminaries}

\section{Notation}
Let $(\mathbb{G},\times)$ be a cyclic group of prime order $q$ with hard Discrete Log (DL) and its generator 
being $g$. 
% isomorphic to a subgroup of the multiplicative modular group $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$, where $p$ is prime. 
Also, we write $\mathbb{Z}_{q}[X]_d$ to denote the set of all $d$ degree 
polynomials univariate in $X$ with coefficients in the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_q$. For remainder of the 
chapter we let $n>t$ for some positive integers $n$ and $t$.

\section{Coding Theory}
\label{sec:linear-codes}
This subsection is a brief recall of linear codes and their properties.

\begin{definition}[Codeword]
  A \textbf{codeword} of length $n$ is a vector $c\in \mathbb{Z}_q^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Linear Code]\cite{gallian2024contemporary}
  If $\mathcal{C}$ be a vector subspace of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with dimension $k$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is 
  said to be a \textbf{linear code}(/ linear $q-$ary code) of length $n$ and dimension $k$.
\end{definition}

In the remainder of the subsection, we let $\mathcal{C}$ be a linear $q-$ary code of length $n$ and 
dimension $k$.

\begin{definition}[Hamming distance]
  The hamming distance $d$ of two codewords of equal length is the number of positions at which the 
  codewords differ. Also, the hamming distance of $\mathcal{C}$, $d(\mathcal{C})$ is defined to be the 
  minimum hamming distance of any two codewords in $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hamming weight]
  The hamming weight $wt$ of a codeword $c$ is the number of non-zero positions in $c$. Also, the hamming weight of
  $\mathcal{C}$, $wt(\mathcal{C})$ is defined to be the minimum hamming weight of any codeword in $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\cite{gallian2024contemporary}\label{lem:distance}
  Given a tuple of codewords of equal length $n$, $(u, v, w)$, let $d(u,v)$ and $wt(w)$ denote the hamming 
  distance of $u, v$ and the hamming weight of $w$ respectively. Then $d(u,v) = wt(u-v)$ and 
  $d(u,v)\leq d(u,w)+d(w,v)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[error]
  A vector $r$ is said to be an \textbf{error} of a codeword $c\in\mathcal{C}$ if 
  $r=c+e$ for some $e\neq 0$ and $e$ is called error term of $r$.
\end{definition}

It is trivial to observe that the hamming distance of error $r$ of $c\in\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum of the 
hamming distances of $r$ with each codeword in $\mathcal{C}$.

\begin{definition}[Detectable Error]
  An error $r$ of $c\in\mathcal{C}$ is said to be \textbf{detectable} in $\mathcal{C}$ if 
  $r\notin\mathcal{C}$, otherwise it is said to be an \textbf{undetectable}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\cite{gallian2024contemporary}\label{th:detectable-error}
  An error $r$ of $c\in\mathcal{C}$ is detectable if the hamming distance of $c$ 
  and $r$ is less than the hamming distance of $\mathcal{C}$, more precisely 
  $d(r,c)<d(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the negation of the statement, i.e., the hamming distance of $c$ and $r$ is less than 
  the hamming distance of $\mathcal{C}$ and $r$ is an undetectable error in $\mathcal{C}$, mathematically 
  we have $d(r,c)<d(\mathcal{C})$ and $r\in\mathcal{C}$. The distance of any two codewords in 
  $\mathcal{C}$ should be at least $d(\mathcal{C})$ implying $d(r,c)\geq d(\mathcal{C})$, which is a 
  contradiction to the negation of our statement.
\end{proof}

The theorem \ref{th:detectable-error} says that any error of a codeword in $\mathcal{C}$ is 
detectable as long as their hamming distance is strictly less than the hamming distance of
$\mathcal{C}$ itself.

\begin{definition}[Correctable Error]
  A detectable error $r$ of $c\in\mathcal{C}$ is said to be \textbf{correctable} if one can obtain its 
  error term $e$ such that $c+e=r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\cite{gallian2024contemporary}\label{th:correctable-error}
  One can find the error term $e$ of the detectable error $r$ of $c\in\mathcal{C}$ if 
  $wt(e)<\frac{d(\mathcal{C})}{2}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We have the following triangular inequality from lemma \ref{lem:distance} for any $w\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
  $w\neq c$:
  \begin{align}\label{eq:triangular-inequality}
    d(\mathcal{C})\leq d(w,c)&\leq d(w,r)+d(r,c).
  \end{align}
  From the equation \eqref{eq:triangular-inequality}, we get 
  \begin{align}\label{eq:triangular-inequality-2}
    d(w,r)\geq d(\mathcal{C})-d(r,c).
  \end{align} 
  Since, $w\neq c$ we always will have 
  \begin{align}\label{eq:triangular-inequality-3}
    d(w,r)>d(r,c).
  \end{align}. 
  From the equations \eqref{eq:triangular-inequality-2} and \eqref{eq:triangular-inequality-3}, we have the 
  following result:
  \begin{align*}
    d(\mathcal{C})-d(r,c)>d(r,c) \implies d(\mathcal{C})>2d(r,c) \iff d(\mathcal{C})>2wt(e).
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

If one wants to correct a detectable error of a codeword in $\mathcal{C}$ then from theorem 
\ref{th:correctable-error}, its hamming distance with the codeword should be strictly less than half 
the hamming distance of $\mathcal{C}$ itself.

\begin{definition}[Dual Code]
  The vector subspace $\mathcal{C}^{\perp}$ is called a Dual (Code) of $\mathcal{C}$ if it is 
  orthogonal to $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Generating Matrix]
  The $k\times n-$matrix $\mathcal{G}$ is said to be a generating matrix of $\mathcal{C}$ if it 
  generates $\mathcal{C}$, more precisely, the rows of $G$ form a basis for $\mathcal{C}$. Also, $\mathcal{G}$ is said to be in its 
  \textbf{standard form} if it is of the form
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{G} = \begin{bmatrix}
      I_k & P
    \end{bmatrix},
  \end{align*}
  where $I_k$ is the $k\times k$ identity matrix and $P$ is some $k\times (n-k)$ matrix.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Parity Check Matrix]
  Consider the linear transformation $\phi$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \phi:& \mathbb{Z}_q^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q^{n-k},
  \end{align*}
  where kernel of $\phi$ is $\mathcal{C}$. Then the matrix associated to $\phi$, $\mathcal{H}$, 
  is called the \textbf{parity check matrix} of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\cite{gallian2024contemporary}
  If $\mathcal{G}$ is a generating matrix of $\mathcal{C}$ in its standard form, i.e., $\mathcal{G} = \begin{bmatrix}
    I_k & P
  \end{bmatrix}$, then $\mathcal{H}$ being a parity check matrix of $\mathcal{C}$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
      -P^T & I_{n-k}
    \end{bmatrix},
  \end{align*}
  where $I_{n-k}$ is the $(n-k)\times (n-k)$ identity matrix where $P^T$ is the transpose of $P$.
\end{lemma}

One can easily check if a codeword is in $\mathcal{C}$ by multiplying it with its corresponding parity 
check matrix $\mathcal{H}$.

\subsection{Reed Solomon Codes}
\label{subsec:reed-solomon}
Consider the set of all univariate polynomials in $X$ of degree at most $t$ over $\mathbb{Z}_q$, denoted by 
$\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$. It is trivial to observe that $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$ is isomorphic to 
the $t+1$ dimensional vector space $\mathbb{Z}_q^{t+1}$, where each vector consists the coefficients of 
a unique polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$. Now, consider the following set of codewords 
determined by the evaluation of the polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$ at $n$ \textbf{distinct} 
points $x_1,\dots,x_n\in \mathbb{Z}_q$:

\begin{align}\label{eq:reed-solomon code}
  RS &= \{(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) : f\in \mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}, x_i\neq x_j \text{ for }i\neq j\}.
\end{align}  

\begin{lemma}
  Assume $n>t$. The hamming distance of any two codewords in $RS$ is at least $n-t$. Furthermore, $RS$ is 
  a linear code of length $n$ and dimension $t+1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For $n>t$, saying that the hamming distance of any two codewords is at least $n-t$ is same as saying 
  that the two codewords in $RS$ are equal in at most $t$ positions. Assume by contradiction that 
  there exists two \textbf{distinct} $t$ degree polynomials $f,g$ in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]$ with corresponding 
  codewords in $RS$ are equal in $t+1$ positions, i.e., their hamming distance is $n-t-1$. As 
  $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is an integral domain, any $t+1$ distinct points in the set 
  $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_q$ will determine a unique $t$ degree polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_t$. 
  As a consequence, we should have $f=g$ in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]$ which is a contradiction.\par 

  The remainder of the proof is by a consequence of the first part. More precisely, each codeword in 
  $RS$ determined by a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$ is actually a unique representation of the 
  polynomial itself as it consists at least $t+1$ distinct evaluations of that polynomial where $n>t$. 
  That is, $RS$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}$ as a vector space which has dimension $t+1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Reed Solomon Code]
  The $q-$ary linear code $RS$ of length $n$ and dimension $t+1$ defined in \eqref{eq:reed-solomon code} 
  with minimum hamming distance $n-t$ is called a \textbf{$[n, t+1, n-t]-$Reed Solomon Code}
  \cite{doi:10.1137/0108018} in $\mathbb{Z}_q$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:detectable-correctable RS}
  All errors in a $[n, t+1, n-t]-$Reed Solomon (RS) code are detectable if their hamming distances with 
  RS are at most $t$ and $2t<n$. Moreover, all errors of hamming distance with RS being at most $t$ can 
  be corrected if $3t<n$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We have that any error of RS has hamming distance at most $t$ with RS. From theorem 
  \ref{th:detectable-error}, any error of a codeword in $RS$ is detectable if its hamming 
  distance is strictly less than the hamming distance of $RS$ itself, i.e., $t<n-t$, which is equivalent 
  to $2t<n$.\par

  To be able to correct the errors of hamming distance at most $t$ with RS, we need $t<\frac{n-t}{2}$ from 
  theorem \ref{th:correctable-error} which is equivalent to $3t<n$.
\end{proof}

In this report, we will use $[n, t+1, n-t]-$Reed Solomon code of the following form:
\begin{align}\label{eq:reed-solomon code-2}
  RS &= \{(f(1),\dots,f(n)) : f\in \mathbb{Z}_q[X]_{\leq t}\}.
\end{align}

\section{Packed Shamir Secret Sharing}
\label{sec:packed-shamir}
$(n,t,\ell)$-Packed Shamir secret sharing (\cite{10.1145/129712.129780},\cite{crypto-1984-905})
 scheme is a threshold secret sharing scheme which is a variant of $(n,t)$-Shamir's 
 secret sharing scheme \cite{10.1145/359168.359176} where $n>2t+\ell-1$. In a nutshell, the $t+\ell-1$ 
 degree secret polynomial with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ which evaluates to $\ell$ 
 secrets is secret shared amongst $n$ parties such that any $t+\ell$ parties can 
 reconstruct back the secret polynomial. Recall that Shamir's secret sharing scheme 
 requires at least $t+1$ parties to reconstruct the secret polynomial in contrast to 
 the $t+\ell$ parties in the Packed Shamir secret sharing scheme. The scheme is
 summarized in the Figure \ref{fig:packed-shamir}.
\input{figures/packed_shamir.tex}

One can observe that all the secret shares of a secret polynomial chosen by the dealer form a codeword in 
$[n,t+l,n-t-l+1]-$RS code. If the adversary is malicious and can corrupt at most $t$ parties, then from 
corollary \ref{cor:detectable-correctable RS}, the honest shareholders can detect the errors if 
$2t\leq n-l$ and moreover all such errors can be corrected if $3t\leq n-l$. Also, one can use 
the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm \cite{welch1986error} to correct the errors.\par

But Shamir secret sharing scheme is designed particularly to defend against passive adversaries and not 
against malicious adversaries. A class of threshold secret sharing schemes which are designed to defend 
against malicious adversaries is Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS). There are many VSS schemes in the literature, 
and as of writing this report the efficient VSS schemes based on Shamir secret sharing are $\Pi_F$, 
$\Pi_P$ and $\Pi_{LA}$ \cite{cryptoeprint:2023/1669} which are alternatives to the original VSS schemes 
from Feldman \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Feldman87}, Pedersen \cite{crypto-1991-1671} and the more recent 
ABCP \cite{cryptoeprint:2023/992}. VSS schemes based on Shamir secret sharing allow shareholders to 
verify the correctness of the shares obtained during both the sharing and reconstruction phases. This enables 
these VSS schemes to defend against malicious adversaries who can actively corrupt $t$ parties as long as 
$t\leq\frac{n-1}{2}$ (In contrast to $t<\frac{n}{3}$ in Shamir secret sharing). Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) is an extension of VSS where anyone can 
verify the validity of the secret shares during the sharing phase. More recently, Pre-Constructed Publicly 
Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPVSS)\cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576} was proposed which is an extension of PVSS. 
The main tools used in VSS, PVSS and PPVSS schemes are the \textbf{Sigma Protocols} which we overview in the 
next section \ref{sec:sigma-protocols}.

\section{Sigma Protocols}
\label{sec:sigma-protocols}
The agenda of this subsection is to give a brief formal background about some important primitives 
used in the PVSS ,$\Pi_S$ \cite{cryptoeprint:2023/1669}, and the PPVSS ,$\Lambda_{RO}$ \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, schemes.
Let $X$ and $W$ be two sets with $R$ being a relation on $X\times W$, and $L=\{x\in X :\exists w\in W, xRw\}$
be the language defined by $R$ where $xRw$ says that $w$ is a witness for a given $x\in L$. 
Also, let $\mathcal{R}$ be a PPT algorithm such that $\mathcal{R}(1^\lambda)$ outputs pairs 
$(x,w)$ with $x\in L$ and $xRw$ where $\lambda$ is a security parameter.\par

Given a relation $R$ and its corresponding language $L$, a \textbf{Sigma ($\sum$) Protocol} 
is a $3$-round \textit{interactive} protocol between two Probabilistic Polynomial Time (PPT) algorithms, 
a prover $P$ 
and a verifier $V$. For some $x\in L$ with $xRw$, in the first round $P$ sends a 
commitment $a$ to $V$. To which $V$ sends a challenge $d$ to $P$ in the second round 
and finally $P$ responds back with the response $z$ to $V$ in the third round. 
$V$ outputs \textbf{true} or \textbf{false} upon the proof verification on transcript
$trans := (a, d, z)$. 
Informally, with a $\sum-$protocol a prover $P$ tries to convince
a verifier $V$ that they know a witness $w$ for a given statement $x\in L$ without 
revealing any information about $w$. To state it formally, a $\sum-$protocol is 
supposed to satisfy \textit{completeness}, \textit{Honest Verifier Zero Knowledge} (HVZK)
and \textit{Special Soundness} which are defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Completeness]
  A $\sum-$protocol is said to be \textbf{complete} for $\mathcal{R}$ if
  the verifier $V$ always accepts the honest prover $P$ for any $x\in L$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[HVZK]
  A $\sum-$protocol is said to be \textit{Honest Verifier Zero Knowledge}(\textbf{HVZK}) for $\mathcal{R}$ if there exist a PPT algorithm $S$ 
  that simulates $trans$ of the scheme corresponding to a given $x\in L$ with any witness $w$ of $x$. 
  That is, given $x\in L$,
  \begin{align*}
    trans(P(x,w)\leftrightarrow V(x)) &\approx trans(S(x) \leftrightarrow V(x))&& \text{, for any witness $w$ of $x$.}
  \end{align*}
  Where $trans(P(\cdot)\leftrightarrow V(\cdot))$ is the transcript of the $\sum-$protocol amongst 
  $P$ and $V$ and $\approx$ denotes the indistinguishability of the two transcripts.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Special Soundness]
  A $\sum-$protocol is said to satisfy \textbf{Special Soundness} for $\mathcal{R}$, 
  if there exists a PPT extractor $\mathcal{E}$ for any two valid transcripts, $(a,d,z)$ and 
  $(a,d',z')$, corresponding to a given $x\in L$ with only a unique witness $w$ and $d\neq d'$ such that $\mathcal{E}(a,d,z,d',z')$ outputs the 
  witness $w$. 
\end{definition}

It is shown that a public-coin, complete, HVZK, special soundness $\sum-$protocol can be made into a
Non Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) Proof of Knowledge (PoK) or Argument of Knowledge (AoK) in the 
Random Oracle ($RO$) model using Fiat-Shamir transform \cite{10.1007/3-540-47721-7_12}. 
In the following subsections, we recall two important NIZK PoK schemes which are used in $\Pi_S$ and 
$\Lambda_{RO}$ schemes.

\subsection{Chaum-Pedersen Protocol for DL Equality}
\label{subsec:chaum-pedersen}
Recall $\mathbb{G}$ being the cyclic group of prime order $q$ with hard Discrete Logarithm (DL). 
For some $g,h\in \mathbb{G}$ consider the following relation:
\begin{align*}
  R_{DLEQ} &= \{(g,h,a,b),x : a=g^x, b=h^x\}.
\end{align*}
In \cite{10.1007/3-540-48071-4_7}, Chaum and Pedersen proposed a NIZK PoK scheme for the DL Equality 
relation, $R_{DLEQ}$. Informally, a prover $P$ can convince a verifier $V$ that they know $x$ such that
it can be used with both $g$ and $h$ to obtain $a$ and $b$ respectively. This protocol is widely used in
many cryptographic applications like threshold decryption, e-voting and Randomness Beacons. 
We summarize the protocol in Figure \ref{fig:chaum-pedersen}.
\input{figures/chaum-pedersen.tex}

\subsection{NIZK PoK for Polynomial DL}
\label{subsec:polynomial-dl}
Recall $\mathbb{G}$ being the cyclic group of prime order $q$ with hard Discrete Logarithm (DL) and $g$ 
being its generator. Consider the following relation for some polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}_q[X]_t$ with
degree $t<n$:
\begin{align*}
  R_{PDL} &= \{(g,x_1,\dots,x_n,F(x_1),\dots,F(x_n)),f(X) : F(x_i)=g^{f(x_i)}, 1\leq i\leq n\}.
\end{align*}
In \cite{cryptoeprint:2023/1669}, Baghery formally introduced a NIZK PoK scheme for the Polynomial DL 
relation, $R_{PDL}$, which is a generalization of Schnorr's ID protocol \cite{crypto-1989-1727}. Informally, 
a prover $P$ can convince a verifier $V$ that they know a $t$ degree polynomial $f$ such that 
it can be used with $g$ to obtain $F(x_i)$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. This protocol is used to construct the PPVSS 
$\Lambda_{RO}$ \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, which was essential in building an efficient e-voting protocol. 
We summarize the protocol in Figure \ref{fig:polynomial-dl}.
\input{figures/polynomial-dl.tex}

In the next section we will give a brief overview of the Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing 
(PPVSS) and its security guarantees.

\section{Pre-Constructed Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPVSS)}
\label{sec:ppvss}
PPVSS was first introduced in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, which is used as a building block to 
construct an efficient e-voting protocol based on Schoenmakers' PVSS \cite{5581ccd9530540479539d21d1d39ae96}. 
Interestingly, the authors in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576} observed that the original e-voting protocol 
published in 1999 by Schoenmakers is an unusual application of PVSS, which led them to discover that 
Schoenmakers PVSS is actually a PPVSS. What sets PPVSS apart from standard PVSS schemes 
is that it can be used to build versatile applications, such as e-voting, randomness beacons etc., and can 
also improve efficiency of some existing protocols. The subtle difference between PPVSS and PVSS is that the 
secret itself is committed by the prover along with all its corresponding secret shares. We now will recall 
$\Lambda_{RO}$, the PPVSS scheme introduced in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576} which is actually based on 
$\Pi_S$\cite{cryptoeprint:2023/1669} in figure \ref{fig:ppvss}.\par 

The security guarantees of $\Lambda_{RO}$ are explained in \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576} which follows from 
the security guarantees of $\Pi_S$, also the authors replaced Schoenmakers' (P)PVSS with $\Lambda_{RO}$ in 
the original e-voting protocol\cite{5581ccd9530540479539d21d1d39ae96} and showed that they achieved 
improvement in the verification phase (7 to 30 times faster in implementation for some parameters).

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, we recalled some basic concepts of linear codes and Reed Solomon codes as an example. We then 
recalled the Packed Shamir secret sharing scheme which is a generalization of the Shamir Secret Sharing scheme \cite{10.1145/359168.359176} 
that was originally designed to defend against passive adversaries and showed its correspondence with 
Reed Solomon codes. As one of the goals of this thesis is to explore threshold secret sharing schemes that 
can defend against malicious adversaries, we then briefly recalled PPVSS \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576} and an example based on 
PVSS introduced in \cite{cryptoeprint:2023/1669}. Moving forward, in the next chapter we will introduce a new scheme called Packed Pre-Constructed Publicly 
Verifiable Secret Sharing (PPPVSS) scheme and give an example whose inspiration is drawn from $\Lambda_{RO}$.
