        \textbf{Initialization:}
            All parties $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and dealer $D$ agree on the prime field $\mathbb{Z}_q$. Also, each party 
            $P_i$ registers their public key $PK_i$ in the public ledger and all agree on a set of commitment 
            keys or public keys, $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, whose secret keys are known to target entities with 
            the cipher text space being a group $(\mathcal{G},\times)$. More importantly, all entities agree 
            on two NIZK proof protocols, one for the dealer during sharing phase $\pi_{PPPVSS}^{share}$ and the 
            other for Pessimistic reconstruction phase $\pi_{PPPVSS}^{pes}$.

        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Share:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dealer $D$ samples a $t+\ell$-degree polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}_q[X]$ uniformly at random and 
              sets $\{f(j)=f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ as the set of all secrets.
            \item For each $1\leq i\leq n$, $D$ computes $f(i)=f_i$ and and encrypts it with $PK_i$ to obtain 
              $y_i=Enc(PK_i,f_i)$. $D$ also encrypts(/commits) to the secrets $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ using the encryption(/commitment) 
              keys $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}$ and multiplies them together to obtain $y_0$. 
            \item $D$ uses the agreed upon proof system $\pi_{PPPVSS}^{share}$ to prove that they have encrypted the shares and 
              committed to the $\ell$ secrets corresponding to the correct polynomial that evaluates to $\ell$ secrets.
            \item $D$ broadcasts $\{y_0,\dots,y_n,\pi_{PPPVSS}^{share}\}$.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Verification:}
            Given public keys $\{PK_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and commitment(/public) keys $\{h_j,PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, 
            any entity can check $\pi_{PPPVSS}^{share}$ to verify the correctness of the encrypted shares $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and 
            $y_0$ being the commitment of the $\ell$ secrets, and outputs \textbf{true} or \textbf{false} accordingly.

        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Reconstruction:}
            Similar to \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, there are two approaches to reconstruct the secrets 
            $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ based on the cooperation of the dealer $D$ which are as follows:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Optimistic Reconstruction:} $D$ publishes $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, then any verifier (not necessarily shareholders) 
                when given $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0,y_0$ can check if $y_0$ is the valid product of the commitment(/encryptions) 
                of the secrets $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ and returns \textbf{false} if the check fails; otherwise returns 
                $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$.
                \item \textbf{Pessimistic Reconstruction:} If $D$ refuses to reveal $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, then any set 
                $\mathcal{Q}$ consisting at least $t+\ell$ shareholders will do the following:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each party $P_i\in\mathcal{Q}$ decrypts their share $y_i$ using their private key $SK_i$ 
                      corresponding to $PK_i$ to obtain $f_i$ and then they publish $f_i$ 
                      along with proof $\pi_{PPPVSS}^{pes}$ which proves that the $f_i$ is the correct 
                      decryption of $y_i$.
                    \item If $\mathcal{Q}$ consists at least $t+\ell$ honest parties, they can use the 
                    lagrange interpolation to compute the secrets $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ as follows:
                    \begin{align*}
                        f_j &= \sum_{i\in \mathcal{Q}} f_i \left[\prod_{k\in \mathcal{Q}, k\neq i}\frac{-k-j}{i-j}\right] &&, j\in\{-(\ell-1),\dots,0\} \\
                    \end{align*}
                    where $\lambda_i=\prod_{k\neq i}\frac{k}{k-i}$ are lagrange coefficients.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{tcolorbox}
