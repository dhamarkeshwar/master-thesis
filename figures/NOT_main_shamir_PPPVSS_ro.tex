        \textbf{Initialization:}
            All parties $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and dealer $D$ agree on the prime field $\mathbb{Z}_q$, a group 
            $(\mathbb{G},\times)$ of order $q$ with a generator $g$, random oracle $\mathcal{H}$. Also, each party 
            $P_i$ registers their public key $PK_i$ in the public ledger and all agree on a set of commitment 
            keys or public keys, $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, whose secret keys are known to target entities.

        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Share:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dealer $D$ samples a $t+\ell$-degree polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}_q[X]$ uniformly at random and 
              sets $\{g^{f_j}:f_j=f(j)\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ as the set of all secrets.
            \item For each $1\leq i\leq n$, $D$ encrypts $f(i)=f_i$ with $PK_i$ to obtain 
              $y_i=PK_i^{f_i}$. $D$ also commits(/encrypts) to the secrets $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ using the encryption(/commitment) 
              keys $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ to obtain $\{y_j=h_j^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ (or $\{y_j=PK_j^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$). 
            \item $D$ uses the PDL proof scheme \ref{subsec:polynomial-dl} to generate $\pi_{PDL}$ as follows:
            \begin{itemize}
               \item Samples a $t+\ell-$degree polynomial $r\in\mathbb{Z}_q[X]$ uniformly at random and 
               computes $\{c_j=h_j^{r(j)}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$(or $\{c_j=PK_j^{r(j)}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$) and 
               $c_i=PK_i^{r(i)}$ for $1\leq i\leq n$.
               \item Using $\mathcal{H}$, $d=\mathcal{H}(y_{-(\ell-1)}\dots,y_0,\dots,y_n,c_{-(\ell-1)},\dots,c_0,\dots,c_n)$ is computed.
               \item Sets $z(X)=r(X)+df(X)$, hence $\pi_{PDL}=(d,z(X))$ is obtained. 
            \end{itemize}
            \item $D$ broadcasts the encryptions of the shares along with the commitment (or product of the encryptions) of the secrets 
              with $\pi_{PDL}$ which proves the validity of the encrypted shares and committed (/encrypted)
              secrets, i.e., broadcasts $\{y_i\}_{i=-(\ell-1)}^n$ and $(d,z(X))$.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Verification:}
            Given public keys $\{PK_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and commitment(/public) keys $\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, any entity can check 
            $\pi_{PDL}$ to verify the correctness of the encrypted shares $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\{y_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ being the commitments(/encryptions) of the secrets. 
            They will output \textbf{true} or \textbf{false} based on the verification of the proof. The 
            procedure is outlined as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The entity checks if $z(X)$ is a $t+\ell-$degree polynomial or not.
            \item Checks if $d=\mathcal{H}(y_{-(\ell-1)},\dots,y_0,\dots,y_n,\frac{h_{-(\ell-1)}^{z(-(\ell-1))}}{y_{-(\ell-1)}^d},\dots,\frac{h_{0}^{z(0)}}{y_0^d},\frac{PK_1^{z(1)}}{y_1^d},\dots,\frac{PK_n^{z(n)}}{y_n^d})$ or 
            $d=\mathcal{H}(y_{-(\ell-1)},\dots,y_0,\dots,y_n,\frac{PK_{-(\ell-1)}^{z(-(\ell-1))}}{y_{-(\ell-1)}^d},\dots,\frac{PK_{0}^{z(0)}}{y_0^d},\frac{PK_1^{z(1)}}{y_1^d},\dots,\frac{PK_n^{z(n)}}{y_n^d})$ .
            \item Outputs \textbf{true} if both of the above checks are satisfied, otherwise \textbf{false}.
        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{0.5em}
        \textbf{Reconstruction:}
            Similar to \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/576}, there are two approaches to reconstruct the secrets 
            $\{g^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ based on the cooperation of the dealer $D$ which are as follows:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Optimistic Reconstruction:} $D$ publishes $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, then any verifier (not necessarily a shareholder) 
                when given $g,\{h_j\text{ or }PK_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0,y_{-(\ell-1)},\dots,y_0$ can check if $\{y_j=h_j^{f_j}\text{ or }PK_j^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ 
                and returns $\{g^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ if the check passes, if not they return \textbf{false}.
                \item \textbf{Pessimistic Reconstruction:} If $D$ refuses to reveal $\{f_j\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$, then any set 
                $\mathcal{Q}$ consisting at least $t+\ell$ shareholders will do the following:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each party $P_i\in\mathcal{Q}$ decrypts their share $y_i$ using their private key $SK_i$ 
                      corresponding to $PK_i$ to obtain $g^{f_i}$ and then they publish $g^{f_i}$ 
                      along with a DLEQ proof \ref{subsec:chaum-pedersen}, $\pi_{DLEQ}$ which proves that 
                      $g^{f_i}$ is the correct decryption of $y_i$.
                    \item If $\mathcal{Q}$ consists at least $t+\ell$ honest parties, they can use the 
                    lagrange interpolation to compute the secrets $\{g^{f_j}\}_{j=-(\ell-1)}^0$ as follows:
                    \begin{align*}
                        g^{f_j} &= \prod_{i\in\mathcal{Q}}(g^{f_i})^{\prod_{k\in\mathcal{Q},k\neq i}\frac{-k-j}{i-j}}= g^{\sum_{i\in\mathcal{Q}}f_i\prod_{k\in\mathcal{Q},k\neq i}\frac{-k-j}{i-j}}.\\
                    \end{align*}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{tcolorbox}
