See table \ref{tab:comp_alba_pppvss_no group mul} for an overview.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In ALBATROSS, a dealer(as a part of \textbf{commit}) should compute $n(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$ commitments and to give a proof he should do an additional $n(\mathbb{P}_{e}+\mathbb{E}_{x})$. Also, on dealer should do $l(\mathbb{P}_e+\mathbb{E}_x)$ for computing secrets and keeping it to himself. In total dealer needs to do $(2n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_{e}]$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In \textbf{Reveal}, a verifier should compute $2n\mathbb{E}_{x}$ which internally requires additional $n\mathbb{P}_{e}$, i.e., in total it requires $(n-1)n(2\mathbb{E}_{x}+\mathbb{P}_{e})$ computations for each verifier.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In \textbf{Robust case} where $t$ dealers do not open their polynomials, a verifier should verify $n-t$ polynomials of honest dealers, i.e., for each honest dealer, a verifier has to do $n\mathbb{P}_e$ to evaluate secret share exponents and does $n\mathbb{E}_x$ to get secret shares and cross checks them in the public ledger. Also, finally the verifier computes $l\mathbb{P}_e$ to get secret exponents and get $l$ secrets by doing $l\mathbb{E}_x$. As there are $n-t$ honest dealers, the verifier has to compute $(n-t)(n+l)(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$.
                \item  In \textbf{Honest case}, everyone would have been honest and so each verifier has to do $(n-1)(n+l)(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Recovery} phase only exists if some party does not 
            open the polynomial leading to PVSS reconstruction phase, in the 
            worst case there should be reconstruction for the secrets of $t$ 
            malicious parties. Given a malicious shareholder who has not opened 
            the secret polynomial, each shareholder/re-constructor has to 
            decrypt their share, which requires $1\mathbb{E}_{x}$ and should 
            give a DLEQ proof that they have decrypted correctly, which 
            additionally requires $2\mathbb{E}_x$; Also the re-constructor 
            should verify DLEQ proofs of correct share decryption from $n-t$ 
            honest shareholders requiring them to do $4(n-t)\mathbb{E}_{x}$. 
            In total, each re-constructor requires $[3+4(n-t)]t\mathbb{E}_{x}$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Using PPPVSS in randomness beacon protocol, a dealer(as a part of \textbf{commit}) requires to do $(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]$ and $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ to compute $\{y_i\}_{i=0}^{n}$. For generating the proof that $y_i$'s are valid encryptions of the secret shares and also $y_0$ is a commitment of the $l$ secrets, the dealer should do $(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]$ which internally requires additional $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$. In total, a dealer has to do $2\left[(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_{G}\right]$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, a verifier should do $(n+l)(2\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$ and $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ for each proof. In total, a verifier has to do $(n-1)(n+l)[2\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]+(n-1)(l-1)\mathbb{M_G}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In \textbf{Robust case} with $t$ malicious parties not opening the secret polynomials, a verifier should do $l\mathbb{E}_x+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ to verify each proof, so in total each verifier should do $(n-t-1)[l\mathbb{E}_x+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G]$.
            \item In \textbf{Honest case} where everyone is honest, a verifier will do $(n-1)l(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{M}_G)$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The computational complexity of each re-constructor in \textbf{Recovery} phase is exactly same as in the case of ALBATROSS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Cost analysis}
The dealer has to do a bit more work in the case of our protocol in contrast to 
ALBATROSS


\section{Communication Complexity}
\input{tables/communication.tex}
See table \ref{tab:dealer_comm} for an overview.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In ALBATROSS, a dealer (as a part of \textbf{commit}) should send $n$ group elements as commitments, $t+l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ that defines the polynomial used in the ZKP and $1$ extra element in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ from RO. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, an honest dealer would broadcast $t+l$ coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ concerning the secret polynomial.
        \item If some party has not revealed their polynomial, then in \textbf{Recovery} phase a re-constructor using PVSS reconstruction protocol should broadcast $1$ element in group which is being the decrypted secret, for the proof of correct decryption, they have to broadcast $3$ more group elements along with a polynomial which requires $t+l$ coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ and $1$ group element from RO.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Using PPPVSS in randomness beacon protocol, a dealer (as a part of \textbf{commit}) should send $n+1$ group elements as commitments, $t+l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ that defines the polynomial used in the ZKP and $1$ extra element in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ from RO.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, an honest dealer would broadcast $l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ concerning the exponents to construct the secret.
        \item If some part has not revealed their secrets, then the communication cost of each re-constructor is exactly same as in the case of ALBATROSS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
