\chapter{Revisiting a Randomness Beacon Protocol}
\label{cha:n}

Randomness Beacon \cite{RABIN1983256} is required in applications like e-voting \cite{10.5555/1496711.1496734} 
and anonymous messaging (\cite{180263},\cite{10.1145/2815400.2815417}) to provide fresh random values to all the 
parties. In 2020, Cascudo and David published ALBATROSS \cite{cryptoeprint:2020/644}, the state-of-the art randomness 
beacon protocol based on a PVSS as a building block where each party in the randomness beacon protocol acts as a dealer once, so that all 
parties can influence the output randomness. Interestingly, we observed that each party is expected to reveal 
their secrets (they secret shared as a dealer) as part of the randomness beacon protocol, but to prove that the 
secrets are valid and not just some random evaluations of the secret polynomial they have to reveal the whole 
secret polynomial itself. As a consequence, if some entity wants to verify the secrets' validity then they have to 
simulate the whole sharing phase of the underlying PVSS protocol, which is very expensive because all the rest of the 
parties are expected to do the simulation of that party as a dealer. For reference, if there are $n$ parties, then 
$n-1$ parties should simulate the sharing phase of the protocol, which in total is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ simulations.\par

In this chapter, we present our randomness beacon protocol in figures \ref{fig:randomness_beacon} and \ref{fig:randomness_beacon_cont} 
which in many cases is efficient than ALBATROSS. To put simply, we replaced the building block being PVSS with 
our PPPVSS $\Lambda_{RO}$ \ref{fig:packed-shamir-PPPVSS-ro}. In the subsequent sections, we will discuss the 
computational and communication costs of our protocol and compare it with the ALBATROSS. We will show that out protocol 
performs more efficient compared to ALBATROSS in many cases and also address the cases where we are not computationally efficient.
More interestingly, we will show that in terms of communication, we outperform ALBATROSS.

\section{Computational Complexity}
\input{tables/no_group_mul.tex}
See table \ref{tab:comp_alba_pppvss_no group mul} for an overview.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In ALBATROSS, a dealer(as a part of \textbf{commit}) should compute $n(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$ commitments and to give a proof he should do an additional $n(\mathbb{P}_{e}+\mathbb{E}_{x})$. Also, on dealer should do $l(\mathbb{P}_e+\mathbb{E}_x)$ for computing secrets and keeping it to himself. In total dealer needs to do $(2n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_{e}]$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In \textbf{Reveal}, a verifier should compute $2n\mathbb{E}_{x}$ which internally requires additional $n\mathbb{P}_{e}$, i.e., in total it requires $(n-1)n(2\mathbb{E}_{x}+\mathbb{P}_{e})$ computations for each verifier.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In \textbf{Robust case} where $t$ dealers do not open their polynomials, a verifier should verify $n-t$ polynomials of honest dealers, i.e., for each honest dealer, a verifier has to do $n\mathbb{P}_e$ to evaluate secret share exponents and does $n\mathbb{E}_x$ to get secret shares and cross checks them in the public ledger. Also, finally the verifier computes $l\mathbb{P}_e$ to get secret exponents and get $l$ secrets by doing $l\mathbb{E}_x$. As there are $n-t$ honest dealers, the verifier has to compute $(n-t)(n+l)(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$.
                \item  In \textbf{Honest case}, everyone would have been honest and so each verifier has to do $(n-1)(n+l)(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Recovery} phase only exists if some party does not 
            open the polynomial leading to PVSS reconstruction phase, in the 
            worst case there should be reconstruction for the secrets of $t$ 
            malicious parties. Given a malicious shareholder who has not opened 
            the secret polynomial, each shareholder/re-constructor has to 
            decrypt their share, which requires $1\mathbb{E}_{x}$ and should 
            give a DLEQ proof that they have decrypted correctly, which 
            additionally requires $2\mathbb{E}_x$; Also the re-constructor 
            should verify DLEQ proofs of correct share decryption from $n-t$ 
            honest shareholders requiring them to do $4(n-t)\mathbb{E}_{x}$. 
            In total, each re-constructor requires $[3+4(n-t)]t\mathbb{E}_{x}$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Using PPPVSS in randomness beacon protocol, a dealer(as a part of \textbf{commit}) requires to do $(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]$ and $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ to compute $\{y_i\}_{i=0}^{n}$. For generating the proof that $y_i$'s are valid encryptions of the secret shares and also $y_0$ is a commitment of the $l$ secrets, the dealer should do $(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]$ which internally requires additional $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$. In total, a dealer has to do $2\left[(n+l)[\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_{G}\right]$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, a verifier should do $(n+l)(2\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e)$ and $(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ for each proof. In total, a verifier has to do $(n-1)(n+l)[2\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{P}_e]+(n-1)(l-1)\mathbb{M_G}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In \textbf{Robust case} with $t$ malicious parties not opening the secret polynomials, a verifier should do $l\mathbb{E}_x+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G$ to verify each proof, so in total each verifier should do $(n-t-1)[l\mathbb{E}_x+(l-1)\mathbb{M}_G]$.
            \item In \textbf{Honest case} where everyone is honest, a verifier will do $(n-1)l(\mathbb{E}_x+\mathbb{M}_G)$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The computational complexity of each re-constructor in \textbf{Recovery} phase is exactly same as in the case of ALBATROSS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Cost analysis}
The dealer has to do a bit more work in the case of our protocol in contrast to ALBATROSS, more explicitly, 
they have to compute $\ell$ more group exponentiations and polynomial evaluations. But as a consequence, 
we decrease computational cost in the \textit{Reveal} phase whenever $l < \frac{n(n-t-1)}{2(n-1)}$, roughly 
speaking, if the number of secrets are less than half of the honest parties then we always perform better in 
terms of computation when compared to the ALBATROSS.


\section{Communication Complexity}
\input{tables/communication.tex}
See table \ref{tab:dealer_comm} for an overview.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In ALBATROSS, a dealer (as a part of \textbf{commit}) should send $n$ group elements as commitments, $t+l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ that defines the polynomial used in the ZKP and $1$ extra element in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ from RO. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, an honest dealer would broadcast $t+l$ coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ concerning the secret polynomial.
        \item If some party has not revealed their polynomial, then in \textbf{Recovery} phase a re-constructor using PVSS reconstruction protocol should broadcast $1$ element in group which is being the decrypted secret, for the proof of correct decryption, they have to broadcast $3$ more group elements along with a polynomial which requires $t+l$ coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ and $1$ group element from RO.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Using PPPVSS in randomness beacon protocol, a dealer (as a part of \textbf{commit}) should send $n+1$ group elements as commitments, $t+l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ that defines the polynomial used in the ZKP and $1$ extra element in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ from RO.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{Reveal}, an honest dealer would broadcast $l$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ concerning the exponents to construct the secret.
        \item If some part has not revealed their secrets, then the communication cost of each re-constructor is exactly same as in the case of ALBATROSS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Cost analysis}
The best to offer from our randomness beacon protocol is the communication cost. Though the dealer has to communicate only 
one extra group element compared to ALBATROSS in the commit phase, as a consequence for a fixed number of secrets the 
dealers' communication cost is constant as opposed to linear in number of corrupted parties in ALBATROSS.
